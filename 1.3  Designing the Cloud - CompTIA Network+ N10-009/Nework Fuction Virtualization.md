# Network Function Virtualization (NFV)

**CompTIA Network+ (N10-009)**

## What is NFV?

**Network Function Virtualization (NFV)** is a technology that **replaces dedicated network hardware appliances with software-based network functions running on standard servers**.

📌 Think: **NFV = Virtualized routers, firewalls, load balancers, and other network services running on generic hardware**

---

## OSI Layer

* Primarily **Layer 3 (Network) and Layer 4 (Transport)** for routing, firewall, and load balancing functions
* Layer 7 may be involved for application-aware virtual functions

---

## Key Functions

1. **Virtual Routing & Forwarding (vRouter)** – Software-based routing
2. **Virtual Firewall (vFirewall)** – Software firewall running on virtualized infrastructure
3. **Virtual Load Balancer (vLB)** – Distributes traffic across virtual or physical servers
4. **WAN Optimization / VPN Services** – Implemented virtually
5. **Service Chaining** – Connect multiple virtualized network functions in a sequence

---

## Advantages of NFV

* **Cost-efficient:** Reduces dependency on specialized hardware
* **Flexible & Scalable:** Deploy or scale network functions on-demand
* **Rapid Deployment:** New services can be deployed via software
* **Simplified Management:** Centralized orchestration of virtual network functions

## NFV vs Traditional Network Appliances

| Feature     | NFV            | Traditional Network Hardware   |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Deployment  | Software-based | Dedicated hardware             |
| Flexibility | High, scalable | Low, hardware-limited          |
| Cost        | Lower CAPEX    | High CAPEX & OPEX              |
| Maintenance | Easier updates | Hardware replacements required |

---

## Common Use Cases

* Enterprise and ISP networks needing virtualized firewalls, routers, or load balancers
* Rapid service deployment in cloud and data centers
* Network service orchestration and automation

---

## Exam Tips

* NFV = **virtualized network services running on standard servers**
* Often paired with **SDN (Software-Defined Networking)**
* Know **examples: vRouter, vFirewall, vLB, VPN services**
* Focus on **benefits: cost, scalability, flexibility**

---

## One-Line Summary

👉 **NFV virtualizes network functions like routing, firewall, and load balancing, running them as software on standard servers instead of dedicated hardware**
