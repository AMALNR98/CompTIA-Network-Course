# Wireless Networks

**CompTIA Network+ (N10-009)**

## What is a Wireless Network?

A **wireless network** allows devices to communicate and access network resources **without physical cables**, using **radio frequency (RF) signals**.

📌 Commonly referred to as **Wi-Fi networks** in LAN environments.

---

## OSI Layer

* Primarily **Layer 1 (Physical) and Layer 2 (Data Link)**
* Security features may involve **Layer 7 (Application)** for authentication

---

## Main Components

1. **Access Point (AP)** – Connects wireless clients to wired LAN
2. **Wireless Router** – Combines routing + AP functionality
3. **Wireless NIC** – Network interface card in client devices
4. **Wireless Controller** – Manages multiple APs in enterprise networks

## Wireless Standards (802.11 Family)

| Standard           | Frequency | Max Speed | Notes                               |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 802.11a            | 5 GHz     | 54 Mbps   | Less interference                   |
| 802.11b            | 2.4 GHz   | 11 Mbps   | Longer range, more interference     |
| 802.11g            | 2.4 GHz   | 54 Mbps   | Backward compatible with 802.11b    |
| 802.11n            | 2.4/5 GHz | 600 Mbps  | MIMO support                        |
| 802.11ac           | 5 GHz     | 1.3 Gbps+ | Wide channels, MIMO, beamforming    |
| 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) | 2.4/5 GHz | 10 Gbps   | OFDMA, MU-MIMO, improved efficiency |

📌 Remember **frequency, speed, and key features**

## Wireless Security Protocols

| Protocol | Security Level | Notes                                               |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| WEP      | Weak           | Deprecated, easy to crack                           |
| WPA      | Moderate       | Uses TKIP, better than WEP                          |
| WPA2     | Strong         | AES encryption, widely used                         |
| WPA3     | Very Strong    | Enhanced security, resistant to brute-force attacks |

## Wireless Topologies

* **Infrastructure Mode** – Devices connect via AP
* **Ad-Hoc Mode** – Devices connect directly (peer-to-peer)
* **Mesh Network** – Multiple APs communicate to extend coverage

---

## Wireless Channels and Frequencies

* **2.4 GHz**: Channels 1–11 (US), prone to interference
* **5 GHz**: Wider channels, less interference
* **Channel bonding** increases throughput but may cause overlap

---

## Common Wireless Network Issues

* Interference from microwaves, cordless phones
* Weak signal / coverage issues
* SSID not broadcasting
* Wrong security configuration
* Rogue APs (unauthorized access points)

---

## Wireless Networking Tools (Exam Focus)

* **Site Survey Tools** – Identify signal coverage and interference
* **Spectrum Analyzer** – Analyze RF signals
* **Wi-Fi Analyzer** – Check channel usage and congestion

---

## Exam Tips

* Know **802.11 standards, frequency bands, and max speeds**
* Know **security protocols** (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3)
* Remember **infrastructure vs ad-hoc** networks
* **AP placement** and **interference sources** are common scenario questions
