# Access Point (AP)

**CompTIA Network+ (N10-009)**

## What is an Access Point?

An **Access Point (AP)** is a device that **allows wireless devices to connect to a wired LAN**.

📌 Think: **AP = Bridge between wired LAN and Wi-Fi clients**

---

## OSI Layer

* Primary: **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**
* Some APs can operate at **Layer 3** for routing or management features

---

## Main Responsibilities

* Connect **wireless clients** to the wired network
* Extend network **coverage area**
* Provide **security features** like WPA/WPA2/WPA3
* Support **VLANs** for network segmentation
* Can manage multiple **SSIDs (Service Set Identifiers)**

---

## Key Features

* **SSID broadcast:** Identifies network name
* **Encryption:** WPA, WPA2, WPA3
* **Roaming:** Allows devices to move between APs seamlessly
* **PoE (Power over Ethernet):** AP can be powered over Ethernet cable

## Types of APs

| Type                    | Description                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Standalone / Autonomous | Independent AP, configured individually              |
| Lightweight / Managed   | Controlled by **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**      |
| Mesh AP                 | Connects APs wirelessly to extend coverage           |
| Outdoor AP              | Designed for external environment, weather-resistant |

## AP vs Router vs Switch

| Feature    | AP                    | Router                  | Switch                       |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Function   | Wireless connectivity | Network interconnection | LAN device forwarding frames |
| OSI Layer  | 2 (sometimes 3)       | 3                       | 2                            |
| Connection | Wireless clients      | LAN/WAN                 | Wired LAN devices            |

## Common Use Cases

* Enterprise Wi-Fi
* Public hotspots
* Extending network coverage in offices or campuses
* IoT device connectivity

---

## Common Problems / Exam Points

* Weak signal → Check AP placement or interference
* SSID not broadcasting → AP misconfiguration
* Device cannot connect → Wrong encryption or VLAN mismatch
* Roaming issues → Misconfigured AP cluster

---

## Exam Tips

* AP is **Layer 2**, connects wireless clients
* **Lightweight APs require a controller**
* Security protocols: WPA/WPA2/WPA3
* Often tested in **scenario-based questions**: e.g., “extend Wi-Fi in an office”
