# Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)

**CompTIA Network+ (N10-009)**

## What is a Wireless LAN Controller?

A **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)** is a device that **centrally manages multiple wireless access points (APs)** in an enterprise network.

📌 Think: **WLC = Central brain for all APs**

---

## OSI Layer

* Primarily **Layer 2 (Data Link)** and **Layer 3 (Network)** for AP management and traffic forwarding

---

## Main Responsibilities

* **Centralized AP management** – Configures, monitors, and updates multiple APs
* **Wireless security enforcement** – Applies policies like WPA2/WPA3, VLAN assignment, ACLs
* **Roaming support** – Seamless client handoff between APs
* **Load balancing** – Distributes clients evenly among APs
* **RF management** – Automatically adjusts channels and power to reduce interference
* **Firmware updates** – Pushes updates to all connected APs

---

## Key Features

* **Single pane of management** for large wireless networks
* **Guest network management** – Provides separate network access for guests
* **Monitoring & troubleshooting** – Detects rogue APs, interference, and connectivity issues
* **Integration with authentication servers** – Works with **RADIUS, TACACS+**

## WLC Deployment Modes

1. **Centralized Deployment** – APs connect directly to WLC (most common in enterprises)
2. **Distributed Deployment** – APs operate independently but report back to WLC
3. **Cloud-based Deployment** – WLC functions managed via cloud service

## Wireless LAN Controller vs Access Point

| Feature   | WLC                | AP                             |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Function  | Central management | Provides wireless connectivity |
| Security  | Enforces policies  | Enforces encryption locally    |
| Control   | Multiple APs       | Single AP                      |
| OSI Layer | 2/3                | 2                              |

---

## Common Exam Points

* WLC **manages APs centrally**
* Supports **roaming, load balancing, and RF management**
* Often paired with **RADIUS for authentication**
* Helps prevent **rogue APs**

## One-Line Summary

👉 **A Wireless LAN Controller centrally manages multiple APs, enforces security policies, and optimizes wireless performance**
